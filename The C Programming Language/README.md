The C Programming Language
=========================

This book is written by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie.
I recommend this book to those who wants to learn C in more detail. Although the book is quite dense, it discusses the major important parts of the language.

By doing the exercises, you get a deeper understanding of the topics in addition to some programming experience.

I'm sure of that most of the exercises could be solved in a better way. If you find some solutions frustratingly bad, please comment.
